Ultralight, non-dependent and minimalist open-source package to recursively generate **sha-256**, **sha-384** or **sha-512** subresource integrity hashes to authenticate **.js** and **.css** files.

```js
import { Srisaurus } from "https://deno.land/x/srisaurus/mod.ts"

let hash = new Srisaurus("SHA-256")
await hash.get("./public/css");
```

[Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) or SRI is a [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/) to provide a method to protect website delivery from CDN-served malicious code.

To use SRI, a website author wishing to include a static resource can specify a cryptographic hash of the resource in addition to the location of the resource. Browsers fetching the resource can then compare the hash provided by the website author with the hash computed from the resource. If the hashes don't match, the resource is discarded.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/app.js"
        integrity="sha384-+/M6kredJcxdsqkczBUjMLvqyHb1K/JThDXWsBVxMEeZHEaMKEOEct339VItX1zB"
></script>
```

This package aims at automating the process of generating cryptographic hashes in order to facilitate their access, by parsing directories and subdirectories to extract static files.

## Features

- Low memory usage
- Executable for generating applications quickly
- High availability for synchronization with CDN systems
- Simple deployment with one-line integration

## Installation

This is a [Deno third party module](https://deno.land/x) module available through the [Deno.land registry]https://deno.land/x).

Before installing, download and install [Deno.land](https://deno.com/manual@v1.33.2/getting_started/installation). Deno works on macOS, Linux, and Windows as a single binary executable. It has no external dependencies.

## Importing

```js
// Using es6 syntax.
import { Srisaurus } from "https://deno.land/x/srisaurus/mod.ts"
```

## Usage/Examples

```js
import { Srisaurus } from "https://deno.land/x/srisaurus/mod.ts"

let hash = new Srisaurus("SHA-256")
await hash.get("./public/css");
```

```javascript
[
  {
    filepath: 'public/css/index.css',
    hash: 'sha384-yTRuc6ItZNScTYLXkpwURSAsaZLKgfoWi69Nku5bK2/1HW2O8OOgcli2jdgvIJnE'
  }
]
```
Then, we can observe the creation of a JSON element, containing each filepath contained in the directory and its subdirectories, as well as the assignment of a unique hash preceded by the mention `"sha256-"`, `"sha384-"` or `"sha512-"` directly exploitable in your routes configuration file.
