Ultralight, non-dependent and minimalist open-source package to recursively generate **sha-256**, **sha-384** or **sha-512** subresource integrity hashes to authenticate **.js** and **.css** files.

```js
const sri = require("open-sri");

sri.get("./public/css", "sha384");
```

[Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) or SRI is a [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/) to provide a method to protect website delivery from CDN-served malicious code.

To use SRI, a website author wishing to include a static resource can specify a cryptographic hash of the resource in addition to the location of the resource. Browsers fetching the resource can then compare the hash provided by the website author with the hash computed from the resource. If the hashes don't match, the resource is discarded.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/app.js"
        integrity="sha384-+/M6kredJcxdsqkczBUjMLvqyHb1K/JThDXWsBVxMEeZHEaMKEOEct339VItX1zB"
></script>
```

This package aims at automating the process of generating cryptographic hashes in order to facilitate their access, by parsing directories and subdirectories to extract static files.

## Features

- Low memory usage
- Executable for generating applications quickly
- High availability for synchronization with CDN systems
- Simple deployment with one-line integration

## Tech Stack

**Server:** Node, Express

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

If this is a brand new project, make sure to create a `package.json` first with the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file). Then:

```bash
  npm i open-sri
```

## Importing

```js
// Using Node.js 'require()'
const sri = require('open-sri');
```

## Documentation

The `get` function take two arguments, the `directory` (`string`) containing static files we want to obtain hashes from, and the required `algorithm` for the calculation `sha256`, `sha384` or `sha512` (`string`). 

Return `JSON` object.

## Usage/Examples

```javascript
const sri = require("open-sri");

sri.get("./public/css", "sha384");
```

```javascript
[
  {
    filepath: 'public/css/index.css',
    hash: 'sha384-yTRuc6ItZNScTYLXkpwURSAsaZLKgfoWi69Nku5bK2/1HW2O8OOgcli2jdgvIJnE'
  }
]
```
Then, we can observe the creation of a JSON element, containing each filepath contained in the directory and its subdirectories, as well as the assignment of a unique hash preceded by the mention `"sha256-"`, `"sha384-"` or `"sha512-"` directly exploitable in your routes configuration file.
